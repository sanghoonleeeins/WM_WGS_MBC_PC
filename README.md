[Visiaul Abstract to represent the direction of Waldenström Macroglobulinemia whole genome sequencing (WGS) data analysis]

Using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to 80x on 47 WM cases (24 newly diagnosed, 11 relapsed, and 12 unknown), we uncover WM subtype-specific single nucleotide variants (SNVs), single base substitution (SBS) signatures, somatic mutations, copy number abnormalities (CNAs), structural variants (SVs), and clonal phylogenies.
